Blog concept: how to create a developer portfolio project

Think which skill(s) you want to showcase (DE)
Think of general idea (dashboard with job trends)
Think of tech stack, bonus points for review with AI (Airflow with Python, Snowflake DB, DBT, Tableau for dashboard)
	Also helpful to discuss repo/folder setup
Other things you want to showcase (star schema data modeling, STA/DWH/DM)
Take note of the questions you have along the way. Or you think other people might have
It's great if you can explain the "why" of what you're doing. (for me: performance and storage will be decreased. that's large amounts of money saved for data intensive companies. that's why data engineers have the right to exist in essence)

Start working. For me:
Find API with data: Remotive

https://remotive.io/api/remote-jobs

Found: one big table
Question came up: why pull this table apart to build it up later? --> benchmark idea. flat vs normalized. Storage, performance, complexity of querying

Insight: most companies don't put their data on a digestible API for open consumption. Often it's for integrating functinality, not for analytics workloads

Another reason for SCD (not sure if that could be through flat file still or needs normalization): the api only gives current job postings, no history. Often happens in the real world, if you want to do a historical analysis you will need the historical data. Most reliable is to keep track of that historical data yourself.

Start understanding the general outline of your dataset - postman / Python
Postman: - Total rows, rows per day, etc



--------------
Benchmark ideas:

	â€¢	Show performance differences in query structure
	â€¢	Measure execution times between flat vs star
	â€¢	Demonstrate storage impacts
	â€¢	Compare ease of querying

ðŸ”¹ Join Complexity Still Matters

You can benchmark:
	â€¢	How many joins are needed
	â€¢	Query readability and maintainability
	â€¢	Performance of LIKE vs bridging tables for tags
	â€¢	Whether GROUP BY performance changes on normalized vs flat models
