<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Platform Engineering is reshaping how enterprises build and run their cloud-native setups, and Humanitec is leading this transformation. Our mission is to help teams build Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that unlock true developer self-service.</p>

With a growing list of enterprise customers and skyrocketing IDP adoption, we are expanding our team.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">This is where you come in.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>About the Role</strong></div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">We are looking for a Senior Product Engineer to help us scale our work to build and scale our category-defining Platform Orchestrator. As a Product Engineer, you will share ownership of how our products are built and evolve, contributing to both our short-term deliverables and long-term vision.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">We work across a modern, diverse stack, including:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Microservices (APIs) written in Go, running on Kubernetes</p>
</li>
<li style="""">

</li>
</ul>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">To thrive in this role, you must be comfortable with start-up life: shipping constantly, rolling up your sleeves to help debug customer issues, working on and contributing to a frequently evolving roadmap, and picking up work across our stack, with a focus on impact.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Humanitec is an all-remote company. Our small teams work closely to do big things. This is a fully remote position. Preferred time zones for this role are UTC-1 to UTC+3.</p>

<div class=""h2""><strong>What You Will Bring:</strong></div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Excellent communication &amp; collaboration:</strong> You are comfortable working in a fully remote environment, working across GitHub, Notion, Slack, Jira, and more. You prioritize and protect your focus time, but don't hesitate to jump on a call when a situation demands it. You don’t offload communication or coordination to product/project managers – you own our work end-to-end.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Strong problem-solving and coding skills:</strong> You value designing solutions to customer problems –  from researching and defining use cases, to writing design documents, to implementing clean solutions that address them.</p>

<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Hands-on experience with infrastructure:</strong> whether you’ve been part of an on-call rotation or just working day-to-day observability tools, you are comfortable rolling up your sleeves to understand the factors at play in an incident or service degradation.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> You are comfortable balancing “perfect” with “good enough,” as an individual and as part of a team.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Modern cloud experience:</strong> You have built and run apps on Kubernetes on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. You are familiar with Docker, IaC (Terraform or OpenTofu), and modern CI/CD pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Bias to action:</strong> You thrive in fast-paced, often ambiguous environments. You take initiative, use pragmatism when making decisions, and value progress over perfection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class=""h2""><strong>What You Will Do:</strong></div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Contribute to our core product:</strong> Engineering at Humanitec is a team sport. You’ll work across our stack - primarily in Go - on services that power our applications. (Experience working in Go is a plus, but not required.)</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Design and refine technical systems:</strong> You will share ownership of customer use cases and the systems that power them – microservices, customer interfaces, automated tests –  and help shape them to remain scalable, reliable, and elegant as they evolve.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Collaborate closely across disciplines:</strong> You will partner with colleagues across the organization to explore problems, prototype ideas, and iterate quickly.</p>

<div>The crushing weight of debt is something that we believe holds people back from reaching their dreams and making a splash in the world. So in 2013, after seeing our friends and family struggle with student loans, we created Splash Financial. 
<p>Over the years, our mission has expanded to include helping people with other forms of debt - such as refinancing credit cards, which are at all time highs in the US. And we’ve been able to refinance $6+ Billion in loans through our network of Splash, powered credit union and bank partners who leverage our marketplace and automated loan processing technology. And we’ve raised over $70 million from investors like partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, TruStage Ventures, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, and more.</p>
<p>But at our core, we’re still that little company from Cleveland with a big dream: to make people more powerful than their debt and we’re just getting started..</p>
</div>
<div class=""h3""><strong>ABOUT OUR WORKPLACE:</strong></div>
<div>Splash is remote-first, and proud of it. We spend our days creating ways to simplify financial products, then get them into the hands of people who need help. Right now, we’re focused on developing financial technologies that fundamentally change the way the industry lends. And to hire the best, we provide the best: great health insurance, competitive salaries, and unique benefits like quarterly meet-ups, access to community, and engagement tools. And although we’ve been around since 2013, we still love to think like a start-up — a place that empowers good people to do great things, fast. <br>
<p>We’re friendly, folksy, and have Slack channels for both #kids-and-pets and #food. We’re good people who want to make a difference in the financial landscape, and we approach tackling challenges with creativity, passion and urgency.</p>
</div></div><p><strong>ABOUT THE ROLE:<br><br></strong>Splash Financial is seeking a Senior Manager of Credit.  The incumbent will be the key driving force behind Splash’s credit performance and responsible for explosive growth in the next few years.  The role will report directly to the VP of Credit and work very closely with other senior leaders in Credit and Operations.  The role will also have frequent exposure to the executive team with plenty room to grow into fully owning credit strategies and managing a team.</p>
