I then switched to Corporate IT, where I helped several companies scale (e.g., Credit Karma, Lattice). I typically came in as the first hire and set up processes and teams. A couple of years ago, I decided to use the security knowledge I gained in Corporate IT and focus on Information Security for the remainder of my career.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">After I <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/letter-frank-weigel-joining-ashby\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">joined</a> Ashby, I implemented some tools and processes on the IT side that helped Ashby scale and its employees work more efficiently.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Now, I am looking for the first dedicated IT hire to join Ashby, be the primary contact for all things IT, and continue the build-out of our IT function. There will be some user-facing support as well as work in the backend systems we use (e.g., Okta). I will still be around to help and provide guidance if asked, but I\u2019ll trust you to take care of IT independently.\u00a0</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">I think it\u2019s important to reassess processes and tools as a company grows constantly: what worked with 100 people and one hire a week does not work anymore with a company of 400 people and five new hires every week. Therefore, I am looking for a person who sets a high bar for their work and the work of others, is responsive, and considers the long-term effects and challenges when addressing a problem.<br></p><div class=\"h1\"><strong>Role Requirements</strong></div><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Customer Service Orientation</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Attention to detail but striving for execution</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">3 years of experience in a similar role</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Familiar with working and troubleshooting\u00a0 in an international remote environment</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Okta SAML, SCIM (ideally Okta Workflows)</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Kandji or similar MDM</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Apple Mac best practices</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Google Workspace</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div class=\"h1\"><strong>You should apply if</strong></div><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are curious and want to learn new technologies and solutions</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You want to provide phenomenal customer service but can also enforce rules and policies</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are constantly looking for improvements to the status quo</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You like scheduling and managing tasks and projects on your own</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div class=\"h1\"><strong>You should </strong><em><strong>not</strong></em><strong> apply if</strong></div><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You expect a lot of documentation on how to do your job</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You expect a lot of ongoing guidance on daily tasks</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You thrive in an in-office environment</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><div class=\"h1\">Benefits</div><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Competitive salary and equity.</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>10-year exercise window for stock options</em>.
