We understand that wine is a complicated and intimidating category to shop, especially for new wine drinkers. That\u2019s why we exist to make it easy for consumers to confidently try new wines and discover what they love.<br></p><p>Firstleaf launched in 2016 with the vision to be the world\u2019s most customer-centric wine company. With a flexible direct-to-consumer model, we combined the roles of winery, importer, and retailer into one vertically integrated company. Our award-winning and talented Winemaking and Operational teams work closely with the finest vineyards and wineries in over a dozen countries to source the best wines possible. By eliminating the middleman, we provide our members with an exclusive selection of world-class wines that have won thousands of awards from notable critics and competitions.\u00a0</p><p></p><p>Founded and led by Philip James, a wine industry veteran and Oxford-educated chemist, our personalized subscription service unites the art and science of wine. Our patented algorithm uses millions of data points to curate each shipment of wine so members can discover wines matched to their tastes while exploring bottles from around the world.</p><p></p><p>This process begins by analyzing the chemical components of each wine so that we understand what\u2019s in every bottle at the molecular level. As a result, after a member takes our quiz and rates a few bottles, we know exactly what they like or don\u2019t like, enabling us to refine their wine profile and recommend wines with over 95% accuracy. This data also informs which types of wines we produce for our members.</p><p></p><p>We were recognized by Fast Company\u2019s Annual List of the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies in 2022, named to Quartz\u2019s Best Companies for Remote Workers in 2022, and ranked in the Top 50 Wineries of the Year three years in a row by Wine Business Monthly.
