<p>We’re Spark, a mission-driven company helping independent Medicare brokers build the insurance business of their dreams. The vast majority of beneficiaries select benefits with the help of an independent broker, but technology and support for brokers is woefully antiquated. We provide workflows and services to help brokers achieve transformative growth.</p>
<p>In just five years, we’ve partnered with over 6,000 brokers and enrolled over 140,000 beneficiaries, making us the fastest-growing Medicare brokerage in the country. Brokers love us: during this period of intense growth, we’ve maintained an NPS of 91 and a client retention rate of 93%, and we’ve helped brokers grow on average &gt;100% since partnering with us.</p>
<p>It’s an exciting time to be at Spark. Our diverse, remote-first team comes from leading technology, healthcare, and insurance companies, and has grown from 70 to 90 in the last year. Most recently, we’ve raised a Series B from leading investors who share our ambition.</p>

<p><strong>To Apply: </strong>Please enter your info and share a bit about yourself with us below. We ask that you do not use Chat GPT or similar tools to answer these questions, as it is our hope to genuinely get to know you and the way you communicate and think! We do love integrating these tools into our work though, and you'll hear plenty more about that if you join us.</p><div class='""content-conclusion""'><p><strong>A bit about us...</strong></p>
<p>At Grüns, we believe that foundational nutrition should be simple and convenient for everyone. We're dedicated to bringing comprehensive and real nutrition to you through our gummies, formulated from 60 nutrient-dense and whole-food ingredients. Simply enjoy a grab-and-go snack pack of gummies daily whenever fits best in your schedule and wherever life takes you.</p>
<p>Like you, we were disappointed. There’s an infinite number of “nutrition” companies, all focused on what’s best for them — not what’s best for you. Hundreds of products to sell you on, low-quality ingredients, and small nutrient doses. We’ve seen it all.</p>
<p>So we decided it was time to fix it. No more choking on and popping pills like a pharmacy. No more clean-up and disgust from gross powders. And no more cobbling together handfuls to dozens of supplements. Grüns is comprehensive nutrition, made convenient and delicious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we care about...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Autonomy</strong>: Only the best work at Grüns. We’re all confident, independent leaders. We are proactive. We find opportunities for improvement. Don’t ask; just do. When our actions impact other areas of the organization, we communicate with those functional leaders to ensure connectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Growth</strong>: We love to take on new challenges, learn new things, and express interest in new functions. “I’ve never done this before” is not an excuse; it’s an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong>: We care deeply about each other. We’re good humans and provide support wherever we can. We care, not just professionally but personally as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Compensation &amp; Perks:</strong></p>
<p>For every role, we aim to have highly competitive compensation and opportunity for impact and career growth.</p>
<p>Everyone at Grüns works hard, but we believe in wellness and balance too. We have super strong benefits coverage -- for you and your family, generous PTO, free Grüns subscriptions, and a few more perks centered around health and well-being that we can't wait to tell you about!</p></div><img src=""https://remotive.com/job/track/1992782/blank.gif?source=public_api"" alt=""""/>"
