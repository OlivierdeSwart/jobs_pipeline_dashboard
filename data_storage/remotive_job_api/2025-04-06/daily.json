We are sharing this information up front because we don\u2019t expect this job to be appealing to everybody and we do not want to waste your time if you are not on board with all of the following.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Being the first recruiting hire at a high growth startup means many different things, but there is one thing above all that it certainly means: hiring success or failure is ultimately your responsibility.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This will be a hard job. We work long hours at AirGarage, including nights and weekends when necessary, because we love what we do. You will be expected to do the same. We are growing fast but our hiring team is lean, so every day you will have new challenges and too much on your plate, but you\u2019ll be expected to find a way to deliver anyways.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Below are some of the reasons you might not want this job:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You are not excited about being the first (and only, for the time being) recruiting / people team member at an early stage company. You should not take this role if you are not comfortable defining your own process and expect to have a playbook handed to you, because there is no playbook in place today.</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t want to be involved in the weeds on every hire, partnering closely with hiring managers to run the entire hiring process from beginning to end, including the nitty gritty tactical work of sourcing, scheduling interviews, creating offers, and everything else involved in running a successful hiring process.</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You don\u2019t wake up every day feel energized to source the next great team member that will come to work at AirGarage. Hiring is an extremely rewarding treasure hunt of sorts, and if that isn\u2019t what you live and breathe for and derive immense personal satisfaction from then you likely won\u2019t feel fulfilled in this role.</p></li><li style=\"\"><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You aren\u2019t comfortable handling people / HR tasks outside of simply recruiting on an as needed basis. We don\u2019t currently have a dedicated people team so compensation planning, end of year reviews, healthcare, 401k, and more fall on to the plates of our Founders and leadership team currently. We\u2019re ideally looking for someone that is comfortable flexible beyond recruiting (which will absolutely be your top priority and focus in this role) to make sure all of these other people related things are taken care of so we maintain a high level of satisfaction among our current team members.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>We understand that there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. We're looking for someone passionate, with grit and determination, who is excited to face the challenges of a rapidly growing startup.
