<p>Department: Marketing, Editorial</p>
<p>Position: Contract</p>

<p>Location: Remote</p>
<p>Experience Desired: 2-3 years </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Veriheal?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Veriheal is a leading platform dedicated to cannabis education, advocacy, and patient access. We provide in-depth analysis, breaking news, and insightful storytelling about the medical marijuana industry and cannabis culture. Our mission is to inform, empower, and elevate conversations surrounding cannabis through high-quality, research-backed journalism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Description </strong></p>
<p>We’re seeking a sharp, creative <strong>Staff Writer</strong> to join our editorial team. This role is perfect for an analytical thinker with a strong writing background who can break down complex topics into engaging, digestible content. You’ll be deep-diving into the cannabis space – breaking news, investigative pieces, trendspotting, and talking to real people whose stories deserve the spotlight. We need someone who’s just as comfortable decoding scientific studies as they are covering the latest industry drama. We don’t just report the news; we explain why it matters. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="""">
<li style=""""><strong>Dig Deep</strong>: Perform high-level research on cannabis-related topics — think medical advancements, policy changes, cultural shifts, and industry trends.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Tell Stories That Matter</strong>: Go beyond surface-level reporting to deliver thoughtful, engaging, and sometimes provocative takes on what’s happening in the world of weed.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Turn Science Into Stories</strong>: Translate dense research, legal jargon, and medical studies into digestible, must-read content. </li>
<li style=""""><strong>Get Out There</strong>: Conduct interviews, attend events, and bring back the kind of firsthand insights you can’t find in a Google search.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Keep It Fresh</strong>: Generate original, conversation-starting content that aligns with Veriheal’s voice and mission.</li>
<li style=""""><strong>Break The Rules (Sometimes)</strong>: Follow AP style (mostly), but know when to step outside the guidelines to keep things engaging and accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yes, You’ll Be Writing: Provide 3-5 deliverables a month that range from 1000-2000 words. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">2-3 years of experience producing high-quality journalistic writing, preferably in cannabis, health, pop culture, or science (Bonus points if you can share links to your bylines!) </li>
<li style="""">A bachelor’s degree in Journalism, English, Communication, or a related field </li>
<li style="""">Strong research and analytical skills and the ability to explain why this research matters in the bigger picture </li>
<li style="""">A knack for making complex topics understandable (and actually interesting)</li>
<li style="""">Passion for cannabis culture, policy, and science and an ability to generate original content ideas that align with Veriheal’s vision and mission</li>
<li style="""">Confidence in interviewing experts, industry insiders, and everyday cannabis consumers.</li>
<li style="""">An eye for what’s next, whether it’s a trend, a regulatory shake-up, or a product that’s about to change the game.</li>
<li style="""">A critical thinker who isn’t afraid to ask the tough questions – and tell the stories that matter </li>
